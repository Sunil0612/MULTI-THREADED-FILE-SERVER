# MULTI-THREADED-FILE-SERVER

ABSTRACT:
This project is based on the concept of Distributed File-sharing Systems. A server has specifically been designed to be the file store for a number of clients attached to a local area network. In particular, these personal machines (clients) have a very limited amount of memory with which to interface to the file server. The filing system supports a hierarchical directory structure. Both the operations and communication protocol supported by the file server are chosen to make a client access to the files simple. Special attention is given for maintaining priority among the clients. Various aspects of the implementation have been executed to ensure the optimized functioning of the server system.
